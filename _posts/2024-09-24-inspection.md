### East hive

- No inspection of this hive
- Bottom board had 52 mites
- Wiped and re-oiled the bottom board.

### Middle hive

- Temperament: buzzing, but not aggressive.
- removed empty frames and condensed down to one deep
- Several frames of stores, pollen and honey
- Did not find the queen, but there was some capped brood and larvae
- I'm a bit concerned that the queen is missing from this hive as well as the western one.
- Bottom board had 19 mites
- Wiped and re-oiled the bottom board.

### West hive

- Temperament: frantic is the best description
- After the OAV treatment there have been lots of bees staying outside the hive
- I think the queen has either left or died
- No eggs found, very few larvae and capped brood
- In 3 days I will go back and check this hive again, if there's no eggs or larvae
I will combine.
- Bottom board had 200 mites
- Wiped and re-oiled the bottom board.

Move middle and west hives close together in preparation to combine them.
