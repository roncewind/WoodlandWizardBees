- Time: ~11.00
- Temp: ~62F, sunny

### East nuc

- Temperament: calm, no smoke needed
- Eggs, larvae, and capped brood present.
- Queen present.
- Open nectar, full frames of capped honey, and pollen
- Drone frame built out, some larvae
- Removed frame of capped brood to put in second hive
- Removed 2 frames of partially drawn comb to put in second hive
- Inner cover is starting to get moldy, seems like there is too much moisture in the hive.
- Removed slide out bottom board and placed below hive in an attempt to reduce moisture.

### West nuc

- Temperament: calm, no smoke needed
- Eggs, larvae, and capped brood present
- Queen present.
- Open nectar, capped honey and pollen present
- Added third brood box
- Added frame of capped brood from other hive and 2 frames of partially drawn comb
- Added top feeder, based on advice from a fellow bee keeper.
- Will only add a quart of 1:1 syrup in the evening to entice bees to draw comb

Tomorrow, I need to check green dot frame to see what happens with the eggs it contained.
One theory is the workers are detecting something wrong with the eggs and are removing
them.

In a couple of days, I'll move another frame of brood from the East hive to
the western hive.

I'll keep an eye on if comb is getting built out and react as needed.
