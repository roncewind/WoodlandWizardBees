This is an OAV diagnostic treatment. I'll be watching the bottom boards closely
over the next few days to see if another treatment is warranted. Given the counts
I'm seeing on a daily basis, I don't believe I'll need anything else, however,
other beekeepers in the area are reporting very high mite loads and are treating
vigorously.
