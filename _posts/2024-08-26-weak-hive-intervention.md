title: "Weak Hive Intervention"

- Temp: ~64F, sunny

Over all observation is is that both hives were very active today. Usually the weaker(west)
hive has fewer bees coming and going, but today there were about the same. Lots of
bright orange, pale yellow, and grey pollen coming in. Many bees making what I think
are orientation flights. I have to wonder if the capped brood I introduced earlier
in the week emerged and that was why all the activity. I'm still very concerned with
the weaker, westmost hive.

### East nuc

- No intervention, strong hive.
- Brood chamber is 3 medium boxes with a medium honey super on top.
- there are at least 2 full capped honey frames in the honey super and lots of
other stores in the brood chamber

### West nuc

- Brood chamber is 2 medium boxes with some stores, but the second box is not
fully drawn out or used.

Full list of interventions so far:

- 1:1 feed in top feeder
- 15% protein pollen patty on top of the top frames of top brood box
- I moved a frame of capped brood from the strong(east) hive to the weak hive

Today:

- removed 1:1 feed and replaced with the below, rationale is that the 1:1 will add too much moisture to the hive.
- quart jar of 22% moisture content honey on stand offs next to the pollen patty
- Iâ€™ve further reduced my entrances to about half of what they were.

Possible actions for this week:

- place the honey and pollen patty on the inner cover, instead of on top of frames.
- add a third brood box to give them space to store extra honey.
- add more capped brood? I don't want to hurt the strong hive.

Future thoughts:

- over winter on top of strong hive with double screen board
- replace queen in spring
