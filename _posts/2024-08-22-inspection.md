### West nuc

This colony still seems pretty weak. They just haven't built up like the other colony.

- Temperament: calm, no smoke needed
- Eggs, larvae, and capped brood present
- Open nectar, capped honey and pollen present
- Removed third brood box
- Added frame of capped brood from other hive
- Added pollen patty to top of second brood box
- Added top feeder with 1:1. I will probably remove this on my mentor's advice now... I'm not exactly sure what to do since I've been given conflicting advice.
