- Time: ~17.00
- Temp: ~65F, sunny, light wind

- Checked syrup and added 1/2 gallon of 1:1 to each hive
- Bees are very active and up in the top feeder
- Bees coming and going from entrances
- Removed inner cover to help with mold. The bee club "common" knowledge seemed to be that you don't need an inner cover with a top feeder. the top feeder acts as an inner cover and it will cause humidity issues if both are used together.
