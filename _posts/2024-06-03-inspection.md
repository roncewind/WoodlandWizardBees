### West nuc

- Temperament: calm
- Eggs and larvae present
- Stopped inspection after finding the above, only looked at half the brood frames.
- Top feeder did not need to be refilled.
- Bottom board had only 2 mites after a week.
- Wiped and re-oiled bottom board.

### Overall observations

- Removed top brood box from both hives, this could be why they don't seem to be taking syrup.
- Three things needed to build comb
    - Working queen
    - Warm temperatures
    - Nectar, not honey, nectar tells the bees it's time to build and expand
- Mentor says they colonies look good and I shouldn't worry about the mite I found.
