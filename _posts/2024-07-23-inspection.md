### East nuc

Everything is getting filled up and built out, except the new honey super. My
biggest concern with this colony is the laying pattern. Seems like there are
nearly too many skipped cells, even though the queen goes back and fills them in
with eggs, I have to wonder why she didn't fill them in to start with or if they
were filled in then what happened to them?

- Temperament: calm
- Eggs, larvae, and capped brood present.
- Open nectar, 6 full frames of capped honey, and some pollen

- Building out drone frame nicely:

- Bottom board had 4 mites.
- Wiped and re-oiled the bottom board.

### West nuc

I'm a little worried about this colony, they've not built up much population.
There are really only 12 or 14 frames that they're using. This is the hive
where I've used Better Comb, but they're not doing much with it. A bit of uncapped
nectar in one frame. They also don't seem to have the stores the other colony has.
I'm also concerned about the queen's laying pattern, seems like there should be
fewer skipped cells. I need to do more research on what a proper laying pattern
looks like.


- Temperament: calm
- Dark queen present:
- Eggs, larvae, and capped brood present
- Open nectar, capped honey and pollen present
- Third brood box mostly empty
- Top feeder: still had syrup, this colony has never really taken syrup well

- Laying pattern doesn't seem good:
