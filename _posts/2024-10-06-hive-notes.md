### East hive

- Bottom board had 24*4 mites
- Wiped and re-oiled the bottom board.
- Bee legs and wings on the bottom board, robbing screens are still in place.
- Inspection showed eggs, larvae, capped brood, though less than summer. this is expected?
- Capped honey, pollen all in abundance.
- Feeding 22% honey and pollen patty at the moment.
- Plan to put in winter feed and put on quilt box soon.

### West hive

- Bottom board had 18*4 mites
- Wiped and re-oiled the bottom board.
- Newspaper fuzz on the bottom board again.
- removed what was left of the newspaper used for combining.
- Inspection showed eggs, larvae, capped brood, though less than summer and less than hoped. this is expected?
- Seems the combining went well, which ever queen won seems to be laying in the bottom most medium.
- There is a deep with two mediums above.
- Capped honey, pollen all in abundance. The deep has capped and uncapped honey, probably 5 or 6 frames of capped.
- The mediums are similarly filled out, there is still room for the queen to lay, which is good.
- Feeding them 2:1 and a pollen patty.
- Plan to put in winter feed and put on quilt box soon.
