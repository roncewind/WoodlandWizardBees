- Stopped inspection after finding the above, only looked at half the brood frames.
- I expected more build up and new comb, but it seems they're keeping to the original 6 frames, for now.
- I noticed quite a few dead bees, though I did see a couple of "undertaker" bees trying to remove the dead.
- Top feeder did not need to be refilled.
- Bottom board was mite free or at most two mites since 19 May 2024.  Are these mites?

- Bottom board had only 2 mites after a week.

### Overall observations

- Removed top brood box from both hives, this could be why they don't seem to be taking syrup.
- Three things needed to build comb
    - Working queen
    - Warm temperatures
    - Nectar, not honey, nectar tells the bees it's time to build and expand
- Mentor says they colonies look good and I shouldn't worry about the mite I found.
